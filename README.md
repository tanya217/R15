IDEA Submission phase
Title: Stabilising Robot
Synopsis:
This project would involve building a 6 wheeled bot with our own suspension system. The bot would foresee obstacles along its route and adjust the wheels accordingly keeping the chassis completely stable.
The bot would employ depth perception to understand the exact dimensions of the obstacles and hence shift the actuators and the wheels accordingly. 

Applications of such a bot:
1. Consider a disaster, let's say an Earthquake:
In case of extremely sensitive situations where stabilisation is of atmost importance, having a lot of jerks along the way might effect the victims, for example in case of a fracture on the neck or a similar situation, any sort of jerk on the way can be disastrous for the victims.
Not only would this vehicle help in rescuing the victims, it will also make sure that they are safe during the rescue operation.

2. It is also extremely helpful when to it comes to cases that involve mobility and transport of Radioactive materials as they require stability during the transportation and the absence of which can result in havoc.
